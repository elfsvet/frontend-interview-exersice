# DTN Frontend/Fullstack Development Challenge

We would like you to build a React application utilizing Node.js and Express to create the supporting API. This may sound like a lot, but we are using a boilerplate project to get you up and running. If you encounter any issues while working through this challenge please share with us what they were and how you overcame them or worked around them. The requirements for the application are listed below in the Technical Requirements section.  There are also stretch goals if you are interested.

This boilerplate is built using the following libraries:

* The user should be able to add a new student
* The user should be able to edit an existing student record
* The user should be able to delete a student
* Before a student can be removed, a confirmation dialog should be displayed that asks the user if they really want to delete the student
* Create a mixin for rem font sizes, and apply it to all headings in correct scss partial. 
* Typescript should be used throughout

## Stretch Goals
